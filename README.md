The objective of this app was to develop the creator skills in back-end and front-end.
This app is has no intention to guide real life investment decisions and shouldnt be used to this purpose.

The app is online through the streamlit package, hance, it was impossible to divide the code into different .py codes.

All necessary packages are listed into the requirements.txt, so if you want to run this code locally (instead of using the already online version), you gotta run "python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal window (while in the folder where the requirements.txt is contained).

Have fun!
